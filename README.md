## Kyber, Saber, and SK-MLWR lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms model checking with Maude

In this repository, you can find:

1) `common.maude`: a base specification, specifying all common parts in the designs of the three lattice-based KEMS.

2) `kyber.maude`: Kyber specification
3) `saber.maude`: Saber specification
4) `mlwr.maude`: MLWR specification
5) `exp-results`: the outputs of the invariant model checkings by Maude with the three KEMs

## Maude installation
Maude is required to execute the checking experiments. Maude version 3.2 can be downloaded from its webpage: http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php/Maude_download_and_installation.
